# TwiceOver
A cross-platform, stand-alone, iterative code review tool.

TwiceOver is in alpha currently. Here is the current development outline for the project:
- twiceover-client nw.js-based thick client to support code review creation from changes on the local system
- twiceover-server node.js-based web server to support sending out code review emails and opening code reviews links from them
